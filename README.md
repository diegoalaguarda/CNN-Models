CNN Models used for the quantification of microboring traces colonizing coral skeletons

Affiliate to the Article from Alaguarda et al. (2023): "Machine learning approach to quantify microboring assemblage dynamics in two living massive corals"

In the Notebook: "Estimation_Coral_Skeleton_Colonization_Microboring_Traces.ipynb" you will find the different steps for the post-processing of the SEM databases authors want to analyze

The different CNN models used for the different corals are available through this link: ""
